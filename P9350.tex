\begin{abstract}
  The LSST software systems make extensive use of Python, with almost all of it initially being developed solely in Python 2.
  Since LSST will be commissioned when Python 2 is end-of-lifed it is critical that we have all our code support Python 3 before commissioning begins.
  Over the past year we have made significant progress in migrating the bulk of the code from the Data Management system onto Python 3.
  This poster presents our migration methodology, and the current status of the port, with our eventual aim to be running completely on Python 3 by early 2018.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Python 3.0 was released in December 2008, just after the release of Python 2.6, with Python 2.7 first being released in July 2010.
The development of the Data Management software for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope \citep[LSST;][]{2008arXiv0805.2366I} began in 2004 \citep{2004AAS...20510811A}, around the time Python 2.4 was released, and was exclusively using Python 2.7 until work on supporting Python 3 began in 2016 \citep{P6-12_adassxxvi}.
At LSST we use many packages that have pledged to drop support for Python 2 no later than 2020,\footnote{\url{http://www.python3statement.org}} including Astropy \citep{2013A&A...558A..33A}, pandas, matplotlib, and Jupyter.
Many of those packages are dropping Python 2 in the near term and are pledging to do minimal support of Python 2 in their Long Term Support releases.
The combination of no new features in these package from 2018 with the commissioning time line for LSST, implies that we should switch to Python 3 sooner rather than later; switching just before, or even during, commissioning starts would cause major complications.

\section{Python 3 Porting}

We used the Python \verb|future| package\footnote{\url{http://python-future.org}} to port Python 2 software to Python 3 and to aid development when supporting both Python versions.
We chose \verb|future| because it is designed to make compatible code look like it is written for Python 3 natively and minimizes explicit checks for Python version.
The \verb|futurize| command worked really well and support for the two stage conversion was important.
Stage 1 modernizes code to use Python 2.7 constructs such as modern exception catching, checking if a key is in a dict using \verb|in| rather than \verb|has_key|, and use of \verb|__future__| for print function.
Stage 2 does more extensive rewrites to support Python 3 changes to builtins and the standard library.
It also replaces \verb|map(filter(lambda())| constructs with more readable list comprehensions.
We found that using the Unicode \verb|str| object provided by \verb|future| to emulate the Python 3 \verb|str| in Python 2 added more complication than was desired so we have left string objects as their native type in many places.
When supporting 2 and 3 in a single codebase, there are times when the code has to include Python 2 types such as \texttt{basestring} and \texttt{long} to allow the Python 2 code to work correctly even though in Python 3 these types are meaningless.
\verb|future| provides the \texttt{past.builtins} package to support this, although using it is a hint to the future that the code will have to be modified when Python 2 support is dropped.
Proper handling of bytes and strings is the biggest headache when switching Python versions, since Python 2 is much more relaxed about string encodings and code that works fine on Python 2 can blow up in surprising ways on Python 3.

The LSST baseline Python 3 is version 3.6.

\section{LSST Python Software}

Python is used widely at LSST with the key software being:
\begin{itemize}
\item Science Pipelines.\footnote{For an overview of the LSST pipeline from the perspective of HSC see \citet{2017arXiv170506766B}.}
\item VO and Data Access Services.
\item Simulations software \citep{2014SPIE.9150E..14C}.
\item LSST Scheduler \citep{2016SPIE.9910E..13D}.
\item Wavefront Sensor data processing \citep{2016SPIE.9906E..3BT}.
\end{itemize}
The biggest user of Python is in Data Management \citep[DM;][]{O3-1_adassxxv} and the bulk of this software was ported to Python 3 in the second half of 2016.
DM are regularly running Python 3 now for science pipelines, data access services and the Qserv database administration scripts.
DM currently use some DESDM infrastructure at NCSA; those will be fixed by early 2018.
The ``sims'' software has been ported to Python 3 and has no remaining issues.
The Scheduler software has had an initial modernization pass to support Python 3 but has not yet been tested.
The Scheduler uses the Software Abstraction Layer \citep[SAL;][]{2016SPIE.9906E..5CM} message system (based on DDS) \citep{2016SPIE.9911E..25R} and the Python 3 bindings were not available until October 2017.
We expect the Scheduler to be running with Python 3 by the end of the 2017.
The wavefront sensor processing software uses DM software and will be running Python 3 when it is completed.

\section{Data Management and Simulations Software}

In addition to supporting Python 3, we have made two major improvements to the Python infrastructure for DM and Simulations:
\begin{itemize}
\item We have replaced our SWIG bindings \citep{beazley2003automated} with \texttt{pybind11}\footnote{\url{http://pybind11.readthedocs.io}}.
      \texttt{pybind11} requires that the interface be defined manually, but does result in a cleaner separation of C++, interface, and Python code.
\item We have adopted \texttt{pytest}\footnote{\url{https://pytest.org/}} as our test execution framework.
      This has significantly enhanced the reporting of test metrics in Jenkins CI, and plugin support has allowed us to add automated \texttt{flake8} testing, parallel execution with \texttt{xdist}, and code coverage.
\end{itemize}

Version 14.0 of the DM Science Pipelines Stack was released in October 2017.\footnote{See \citet{P056_adassxxv} for an overview of version 11.0.}
This is the first release using pybind11.
This release also begins to use the Starlink AST library \citep{2016A&C....15...33B} for WCS handling.
Full release notes can be found at: \url{https://pipelines.lsst.io/releases/notes.html}.

\section{Dropping Python 2}

We have been supporting Python 3 and Python 2 in the Data Management software since Summer 2016, and this has given our user community time to become accustomed to Python 3.
There is though a cost to supporting Python 2, with extra Continuous Integration resources, source code distractions with constructs that are not needed in Python 3, and developers having to understand that they cannot use Python 3 features and either running with two local installations or discovering late that their working code fails on Python 2.
To simplify our development roadmap and give clarity to the community, LSST DM will drop support for Python 2 following the release of v15.0 of the DM  Pipelines Stack in Spring 2018.
We will support critical bug fixes to v15.0 until the release of v16.0 in late 2018. This timeline is consistent with the release of Astropy v3.0; their first release without Python 2 support \citep{APE10}.

\section{Summary}

LSST will be using Python 3.6 internally starting in 2018.
This includes data challenges, and integration and testing activities.
The Data Management software will drop support for Python 2 following the release of v15.0 in Spring 2018.
